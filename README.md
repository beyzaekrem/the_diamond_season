# The Diamond Season

A cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter**.  
This repository contains the mobile implementation of the *The Diamond Season* project, demonstrating modular architecture and scalable UI for multi-platform support (Android, iOS, web, desktop).

---

## Overview

The Diamond Season is a mobile application developed using Flutter.  
It showcases a structured approach to building responsive user interfaces and prepares the codebase for future backend integration, data synchronization, and interactive features.

This project serves as a foundation for a full-stack mobile solution with cross-platform compatibility.

---

## Motivation

Mobile applications are a primary interaction point for users in modern software ecosystems.  
The goal of this project is to design a maintainable and scalable mobile architecture using Flutter while demonstrating:

- Cross-platform UI development (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)  
- Clean code organization  
- Modular component design  
- Prepared service layer for future APIs

---

## Key Features

- Modular Flutter project structure  
- Reusable widget library  
- Multi-platform support  
- Separation of UI and business logic  
- Backend ready service layer (prepared)

---

## Technologies Used
